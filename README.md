# APPLICATION-VISUALIZING-STATISTICS-OF-CHESS-GAMES
The application allows users to analyze chess games and visualize data from chess.com. Built with R and the Shiny framework, it features several interactive sections.

On the main page, users are introduced to the appâ€™s features and how to navigate through the menu.

The Player Comparison feature lets users input two chess.com usernames to compare their stats. It generates charts that show the types of games they play (e.g., blitz, rapid), their preferred time controls, and their most common openings.

In the Correspondence Analysis section, users can analyze the relationship between game start times and outcomes, helping to identify patterns in performance based on time of play.
